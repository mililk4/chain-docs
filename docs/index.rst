Welcome to Crypto.com Chain's documentation!
============================================
The high-level design vision is documented in

1) `whitepaper
<https://crypto.com/images/chain_whitepaper.pdf>`_ and

2) `technical whitepaper

For a bit clearer technical vision, see

The documentation in this repository site is meant to provide
specifications and implementation details that will be
useful to third party developers or contributors
