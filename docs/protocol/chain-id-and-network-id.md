# Chain ID 

## Chain ID

Crypto.com Chain has different Chain ID to distinguish between _devnet_, _testnet_ and _mainnet_. When running the Crypto.com Chain in your local environment, you will also need to decide your own Chain ID.

Different chain has different address prefixes for its corresponding network types, these prefixes are:

| Mainnet | Testnet | Devnet |
| ------- | ------- | ------- |
| `cro`   | `tcro`  | `dcro`  |

For example, our testnet Chain ID is `testnet-thaler-crypto-com-chain-42`. (TODO: testnet chain-id update)
